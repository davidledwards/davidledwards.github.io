# Instructions
The source files for **light** and **dark** mode CSS themes are located in this directory. Any modification of either theme requires regeneration of CSS files. The Bulma website can always be referenced for proper [instructions](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-node-sass/).

Ensure that `npm` is installed.

Run the following command to generate CSS files.
```
$ npm run css-build
```

The resulting CSS files are written to the `../css` directory.

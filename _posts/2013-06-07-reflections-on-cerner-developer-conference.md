Our [company](http://www.cerner.com) just wrapped up its third annual developer conference in Kansas City with nearly 2,500
people in attendance. A number of technology companies have already been doing this sort of thing for many years, but in the
healthcare IT industry, such events are relatively infrequent or unheard of. A significant cultural shift within our engineering
group that occurred more than a decade ago led to a grassroots creation of this annual event. Cerner is one of the few, if not
only, longstanding healthcare software companies actively pushing traditional boundaries in an industry ripe for innovation.

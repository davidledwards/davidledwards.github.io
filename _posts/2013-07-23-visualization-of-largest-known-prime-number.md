This is a visualization of the [largest known prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number) discovered
on 25 Jan 2013. The image was generated by an algorithm described [here](https://github.com/davidledwards/huge-prime).

I have a 60"x60" poster sitting in my office, which turns out to be quite the conversation piece.

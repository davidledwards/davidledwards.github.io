<div class="content" markdown="1">

Daunting is the prospect of daring leadership,  
With vulnerability inviting a partnership.  
And those that reckon with demons inside,  
Dispense the armor and cast aside.

Shadows of perfection echo within,  
As judgment seeks to reign therein.  
Closed is the mind that aims to criticize,  
And empty is the heart that fails to realize.

Courageous are those that long to listen,  
Shedding the cloak of all that glistens.  
Forever tossed to the shadow of darkness,  
Judgment yields to empathy and kindness.

Rumble we must with vulnerability in sight,  
Living our values to the fullest of might.  
Braving the trust that beckons rapport,  
Awakens the soul to rise and explore.

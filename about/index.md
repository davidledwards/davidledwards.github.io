## Professional
I am currently a Vice President and Engineering Fellow at [Cerner](http://www.cerner.com), a global health care information
technology company headquartered in [Kansas City, Missouri](https://goo.gl/maps/g1TaiVfG5BT2).

I have executive responsibility for a high-caliber application infrastructure group that designs and builds web-scale services
primarily centered around authentication, authorization, auditing, administration, and petabyte-sized data ingestion and
processing. Aside from my day job, I spend a significant amount of time focused on strategic technology and architecture
imperatives with an emphasis on accelerating our transition from traditional enterprise applications to service-based solutions
and platforms.

I have an extensive background in software development, particularly in the areas of application architecture, scalable
computing and distributed systems. During my nearly 25 years with Cerner, I have been instrumental in leading the company
through pivotal shifts in technology and architecture, and have also been influential in incubating and promoting the use of
collaborative and agile engineering methodologies.

In 2008, I was awarded the Engineering Fellow designation in recognition for a number of distinguished technical contributions.

## Education
BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from [Northwest Missouri State University](http://www.nwmissouri.edu).

I also serve as a member of the Computer Science Professional Advisory Board.

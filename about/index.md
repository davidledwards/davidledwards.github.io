## Professional

#### Cerner
I am currently a Vice President and Engineering Fellow at [Cerner](http://www.cerner.com), a global health care information
technology company headquartered in [Kansas City, Missouri](https://goo.gl/maps/g1TaiVfG5BT2). The global reach of our solutions
now spans more than 30 countries.

I have executive responsibility for a very talented application infrastructure group that designs and builds web-scale services
primarily centered around authentication, authorization, auditing, administration, and petabyte-sized data ingestion and
processing. In addition to my day job, I spend a significant amount of time focused on strategic technology and architecture
imperatives with an emphasis on accelerating our transition from traditional enterprise applications to service-based solutions
and platforms.

I have an extensive background in software development, particularly in the areas of application architecture, scalable
computing and distributed systems. During my nearly 25 years with Cerner, I have been instrumental in leading the company
through pivotal shifts in technology and architecture, and have also been influential in promoting the use of more
collaborative and nimble engineering processes.

In 2008, I was awarded the Engineering Fellow designation in recognition for a number of distinguished technical contributions.

#### SMRxT
In 2014, I became a technical advisor for an early stage health care startup, [SMRxT](http://smrxt.com), on matters
related to software architecture, product strategy, information security and regulatory compliance.

## Personal
My first exposure to computing happened around the age of 10 when my father brought home an
[HP-97 calculator](http://www.hpmuseum.org/hp6797.htm), which he used at work to run curve fitting programs to assist in the
optimization of manufacturing processes.

This particular calculator was capable of storing programs on a magnetic strip, which can be seen dangling at the left of the
LED display. It could only be programmed by expressing computations in
[postfix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), so I became somewhat familiar with the idea of using
a stack for evaluation. It was also perhaps a gentle introduction to
[automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory).

Access to personal computers in the late 1970's was quite difficult, but I managed to convince the school principal to grant
me access to the _only_ computer on the entire premises, an [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II). I would
furiously write BASIC programs on paper during weeknights, then spend the weekends banging away at the keyboard trying to make
them come alive. Ah, how things have changed, but those were formidable days.

While attending my sophomore year at [Northwest Missouri State University](http://www.nwmissouri.edu), I spent most of my free
time developing a text editor in [Turbo Pascal 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal). Not that the world needed more
text editors at the time, but this was more about learning and exploring and building something nontrivial. In retrospect, this
single project contributed more to my professional success than any other academic endeavor. Unfortunately, the original source
code has been misplaced.

## Education
BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from [Northwest Missouri State University](http://www.nwmissouri.edu).

## Projects
I spend a bit of my spare time working on a few open source projects written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org).

* [zookeeper](http://loopfor.com/zookeeper)
* [scalop](http://loopfor.com/scalop)

Other projects can be found on my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/davidledwards).

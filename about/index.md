## Professional
A complete picture of my professional life can be found [here](https://linkedin.com/in/davidledwards).

#### Vendavo

##### Since 2016
I am currently the CTO at [Vendavo](http://www.vendavo.com), a global software and services company headquartered in
[Denver](https://goo.gl/maps/YhCJhNTBw1S2) focused on helping enterprises sell more profitably. In a nutshtell, our primary
goal is to help clients identify and harvest margin opportunities.

I have responsibility for Engineering and User Experience. Even though our headquarters are located in Denver, the
engineering teams are geographically dispersed--[Dallas](https://goo.gl/maps/AvFHACVURe32),
[San Jose](https://goo.gl/maps/TYpn6CdYdwC2), [Prague](https://goo.gl/maps/uKyN8qxyWH62),
[Ostrava](https://goo.gl/maps/L3nMC8Xb6Gy), [Hradec Kralove](https://goo.gl/maps/69ya1kAFNcN2),
[Stockholm](https://goo.gl/maps/ehfkpwVLvTE2)
and [Skopje](https://goo.gl/maps/M1KannUcvTv), to be precise.

#### SMRxT

##### Since 2014
I am also an angel investor and technical advisor for an early stage health care startup, [SMRxT](http://smrxt.com), advising
on matters related to software architecture, product strategy, information security and regulatory compliance.

#### Cerner

##### 1991 to 2016
I was previously Vice President and Engineering Fellow at [Cerner](http://www.cerner.com), a global health care information
technology company headquartered in [Kansas City, Missouri](https://goo.gl/maps/g1TaiVfG5BT2). At the time of my departure,
the global reach of Cerner solutions spanned more than 30 countries.

Prior to leaving, I had executive responsibility for a very talented software infrastructure group that designed and built
web-scale services primarily centered around authentication, authorization, auditing, administration, and petabyte-sized data
ingestion and processing. In addition to my day job, I spent a significant amount of time focused on strategic technology and
architecture imperatives with an emphasis on accelerating the transition from traditional enterprise applications to
service-based solutions and platforms.

I have an extensive background in software development, particularly in the areas of application architecture, scalable
computing and distributed systems. During my 25 years with Cerner, I had been instrumental in leading the company through
pivotal shifts in technology and architecture, and had also been influential in promoting the use of more collaborative and
nimble engineering processes.

In 2008, I was awarded the Engineering Fellow designation in recognition for a number of distinguished technical contributions.

## Personal
My first exposure to computing happened around the age of 10 when my father brought home an
[HP-97 calculator](http://www.hpmuseum.org/hp6797.htm), which he used at work to run curve fitting programs to assist in the
optimization of manufacturing processes.

This particular calculator was capable of storing programs on a magnetic strip, which can be seen dangling at the left of the
LED display. It could only be programmed by expressing computations in
[postfix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), so I became somewhat familiar with the idea of using
a stack for evaluation. It was also perhaps a gentle introduction to
[automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory).

Access to personal computers in the late 1970's was quite difficult, but I managed to convince the school principal to grant
me access to the _only_ computer on the entire premises, an [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II). I would
furiously write BASIC programs on paper during weeknights, then spend the weekends banging away at the keyboard trying to make
them come alive. Ah, how things have changed, but those were formidable days.

While attending my sophomore year at [Northwest Missouri State University](http://www.nwmissouri.edu), I spent most of my free
time developing a text editor in [Turbo Pascal 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal). Not that the world needed more
text editors at the time, but this was more about learning and exploring and building something nontrivial. In retrospect, this
single project contributed more to my professional success than any other academic endeavor. Unfortunately, the original source
code has been misplaced.

I spent about 18 years doing hardcore software engineering, much of that focused on building cross-platform middleware,
protocols, services, tools, compilers and management applications. Designing middleware around a single code base to run on
VMS, AIX, Windows and Linux teaches you a lot about portability and how to design systems. I realized much later in my career
that great software design is a blending of art and science, though for me, it was something that seemed to come naturally.
Twenty years ago, there were a lot of software engineers that understood how to design systems. Today, it seems like a lost
art, with the emphasis being more about getting _shit_ out the door and hitting the jackpot rather than taking professional
pride in the elegance of design.

## Education
BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from [Northwest Missouri State University](http://www.nwmissouri.edu).

## Projects
I spend a bit of my spare time working on a few open source projects written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org).

* [zookeeper](http://davidedwards.io/zookeeper)
* [scalop](http://davidedwards.io/scalop)

Another project worth mentioning is a relatively simple [compiler and interpreter](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn) I
developed for instructional purposes as part of a Cerner developer conference talk. The goal was getting attendees interested
in functional programming, so the compiler was implemented in a purely functional style using Scala. I suggested during the
talk that attendees port the compiler to their favorite functional language. I am currently working on a
[Haskell implementation](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn-haskell) as an effective means of learning the language.

* [rpn](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn)
* [rpn-haskell](https://github.com/davidledwards/rpn-haskell)

Other projects can be found on my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/davidledwards).
